Dear grader,

- Folder structure should be compativle with the project rubric.

- src/scripts folders contain .sh files where each .sh files should run 
without problem and raises all necessary nodes and launch files.

- src folder contains all necessary ros built-in packages and catkin_make should succeed.

- For localization, I utilized the AMCL launch file in the turtlebot.

- For slam, I utilized the turtlebot gmapping package. I also had the map avaliable from my previous RTAB project.

- The code in the add_markers handles the position of marker.
Thanks in advance!
